# brainbits Javascript Codestyle

This repository contains extensible eslint configurations we use at [brainbits](https://www.brainbits.net).

As we use this in very versatile projects, our rule set comes in different flavours:

- [**`eslint-config-brainbits`**](./packages/base/README.md)
  Contains rules for vanilla javascript projects. It is also the base for all more specific rule sets.

- [**`eslint-config-brainbits-angular`**](./packages/angular/README.md)
  Rules for angular projects

- [**`eslint-config-brainbits-jest`**](./packages/jest/README.md)
  Can additionally be added to a project when using jest for testing

- [**`eslint-config-brainbits-react`**](./packages/react/README.md)
  Rules for our react based projects

- [**`eslint-config-brainbits-typescript`**](./packages/typescript/README.md)
  A base ruleset for projects using typescript.

- [**`eslint-config-brainbits-typescript-react`**](./packages/typescript-react/README.md)
  Rules for react projects which use typescript as well.
